# How to add my custom component?

To create a custom component, you need to declare a new system that will store and manage 
your components. The component itself contains only data and functions to handle this 
data. All other component logic should reside in the system.

First, declare a new component in the new C++ header file of your system 
`include/my-app/system/my-system.hpp`, by inheriting it from the base **Component** structure.

#### my-system.hpp

```cpp
#pragma once
#include "ecsm.hpp"

namespace my::app
{

using namespace ecsm;

struct MyCustomComponent : public Component
{
    int someValue = 123;
};

// Declare system here \/

}
```

Next, declare a new system by inheriting from **ComponentSystem<>**, which already includes 
some functions necessary for the system to work with components. You can also inherit from 
the base **System** class and manually define all required functions. After declaring your 
system's functions in the header file, you also need to implement the logic for these 
functions in the system *.cpp* file `source/system/my-system.cpp`.

#### my-system.hpp

```cpp
//...

class MyCustomSystem : public ComponentSystem<MyCustomComponent, false>
{
    std::string_view getComponentName() const override;
    friend class ecsm::Manager;
};

//...
```

#### my-system.cpp

```cpp
#include "my-app/system/my-system.hpp"

using namespace my::app;

const std::string_view MyCustomSystem::getComponentName() const
{
    static const string name = "My Custom";
    return name;
}
```

Once you have declared your component and its system, you need to create an 
instance of the system during the manager's initialization in the main function.

#### main.cpp

```cpp
#include "garden/main.hpp"
#include "my-app/system/my-system.hpp"

using namespace garden;
using namespace my::app;

static void entryPoint()
{
    auto manager = new Manager();

    //...
    manager->createSystem<MyCustomSystem>();
    //...

    manager->initialize();
    manager->start();
    delete manager;
}

GARDEN_DECLARE_MAIN(entryPoint)
```

Now you can add, modify, or delete your component on an entity using the **Manager** 
instance to implement the desired functionality for the new component.

```cpp
//...

auto manager = Manager::Instance::get();
auto someEntity = manager->createEntity();
auto myCustomView = manager->add<MyCustomComponent>(someEntity);
myCustomView->someValue = 456;

//...

auto myCustomView = manager->get<MyCustomComponent>(someEntity);
if (myCustomView->someValue == 456)
    manager->remove<MyCustomComponent>(someEntity);
manager->destroy(someEntity);

//...
```

For more **ComponentSystem** functions see the ECSM [documentation](https://cfnptr.github.io/ecsm/classecsm_1_1ComponentSystem.html).

## Additionally

You can also inherit your system from the **Singleton<>** class for faster 
access to your system and the components added to an entity. (These functions 
bypass system lookup inside the **Manager**, which improves performance)

```cpp
//...

class MyCustomSystem : public ComponentSystem<MyCustomComponent, false>,
    public Singleton<MyCustomSystem>

//...
```

Faster system and entity component access:

```cpp
//...

auto myCustomSystem = MyCustomSystem::Instance::get();
auto myCustomView = myCustomSystem->getComponent(someEntity);
myCustomView->someValue = 789;

//...
```


# How to iterate over components?

To iterate over components in your **ComponentSystem<>** system, you can use 
two methods: a standard iterator or by obtaining an array and its size.

**Note!** Component container **LinearPool<>** contains both allocated and 
unallocated components. It is essential to check this by using `component->getEntity()`.

```cpp
//...

for (auto& component : components)
{
    if (!component->getEntity())
        continue;

    // Process your component
}

//...
```

Or

```cpp
//...

auto componentData = components.getData();
auto componentOccupancy = components.getOccupancy();

for (uint32 i = 0; i < componentOccupancy; i++)
{
    auto component = &componentData[i];
    if (!component->getEntity())
        continue;

    // Process your component
}

//...
```


# How to access another system components?

To use components from another system in your own system, first include the other 
system at the beginning of your file and add `using namespace ...;` of that system.

#### my-system.cpp

```cpp
#include "my-app/system/my-system.hpp"
#include "garden/system/transform.hpp"

using namespace garden;
using namespace my::app;

//...
```

Now we can get a view of the desired entity component using 
`AnotherSystem::Instance::get()` or the **Manager**.

```cpp
//...

auto transformSystem = TransformSystem::Instance::get();
auto transformView = transformSystem->getComponent(someEntity);

//...
```

Or

```cpp
//...

auto manager = Manager::Instance::get();
auto transformView = manager->get<TransformComponent>(someEntity);

//...
```

**Note!** It's better to access a component using the system instance rather than 
the **Manager**, as this bypasses the system lookup inside, improving performance.
